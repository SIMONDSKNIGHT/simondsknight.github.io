## Implementation

- Repurposed and cleaned the George Mason University Speech Accent Archive into a large and vetted dataset.  
- Designed and ran large-scale experiments on Whisper to test bias across accents.  
- Applied data analysis and statistical methods to derive significant results.  

## Notes

- Represented the **largest dataset ever used to test Whisper** (by speaker number and variety) at the time of dissertation.  
- Demonstrated systematic bias in Whisper’s performance based on speaker accent.  
- Built reproducible pipelines for evaluation and analysis.
