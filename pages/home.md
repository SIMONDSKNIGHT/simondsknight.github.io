  <span class="emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span> Hi, Iâ€™m Simon!

<p class="intro">
Iâ€™m a newly graduated software engineer who enjoys building interesting projects and hopes to bring my abilities to your company. I focus on practical systemsâ€”backend services, data/video tooling, and lightweight UIs when they help. I like clear APIs, measurable outcomes, and designing with clear specs, solid interfaces, and tests, so deployment is straightforward and low-risk.

- Currently exploring roles in backend/platform, data tooling, and full-stack.
