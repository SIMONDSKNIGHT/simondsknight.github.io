Hi, I’m **Simon Knight**—a Masters in Computer Science (MInf) graduate based in London. I like designing and building practical systems, crisp web UIs, and the occasional ML experiment. I work iteratively and favour a design-heavy, deployment-light approach: clarify requirements up front, then ship smoothly.

## Education
**MInf / MSc in Informatics (Computer Science)** — *University of Edinburgh*  
2:1 with Honours. Achieved **80%** on master’s dissertation.  
Focus: databases, cloudprogramming, software engineering, data/ML, and systems design.

## Experience
**Vido Research** — *Development Intern (Summer 2024, Japan)*  
Built data-acquisition and workflow tooling for investor research. Prototyped scrapers and EDINET API ingestion for Japanese filings to maintain an up-to-date exec/board database; automated reporting; laid groundwork for client distribution on GCP.

## Skills
**Languages:** Python, Java, Haskell, SQL, JavaScript (HTML/CSS)

**Strengths:** streaming/system design, clean APIs, testable code, data pipelines

## Languages
English (native) • Japanese (JLPT N1/fluent)

## Selected Projects
- **Data→Video Encoder (POC):** secure file-in-video pipeline using AEAD, frame encoding, and FFmpeg muxing; fully reversible. Desktop UI (Electron/React), orchestration in FastAPI/Python.  
- **Stock Prediction with LSTM:** end-to-end pipeline (cleaning, scaling, windowing, training, baselines) in Python/TensorFlow.
