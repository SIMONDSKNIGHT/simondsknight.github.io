Hi, Iâ€™m **Simon Knight**! I'm a fresh Computer Science graduate currently based in London, UK, who loves designing and building systems, nifty web doo-dads, and dabbling in ML Experiments. I like iterative development and sharing my ideas through my creations!

**Education.** MSc (Informatics/Computer Science), University of Edinburgh (2:1 overall; 80% dissertation). Coursework emphasized system design, data science, databases, ML, and software engineering. 

**Recent work.** Research/engineering intern at **Vido Research** (Japan): Primarily was put to work prototyping potential financial research software. built scrapers + EdiNET API ingestion for company executive data, automated parsing/updates, and laid groundwork for distribution pipelines on GCP.

**Skills.** Most strong ðŸ’ª with Python, but equally comfortable with Java. Experience with JS, both in conjunction with HTML and CSS for some web dev, but also for creating Frontends with React. Confident with SQL(PostGreSQL, MySQL) and with terminal languages. My secret favorite language is Haskell!


**Languages.** Native English; fluent Japanese (JLPT N1)â€”comfortable in business contexts. 

**Selected projects.**
